# Responsible for parsing a list of files in order. The
# {#parse} method of this class can be called from the
# {SourceParser#globals} globals state list to re-enter
# parsing for the remainder of files in the list recursively.

class YARD::Parser::OrderedParser
  # @return [Array<String>] the list of remaining files to parse
  attr_accessor files: Array[String]
  # Creates a new OrderedParser with the global state and a list
  # of files to parse.

  # @note OrderedParser sets itself as the +ordered_parser+ key on
  #   global_state for later use in {Handlers::Processor}.

  #   state during parsing
