# Modifies the current parsing visibility (public, protected, or private).
# If this directive is defined on a docstring attached to an object
# definition, it is applied only to that object. Otherwise, it applies
# the visibility to all future objects in the namespace.
#
# @example Modifying the visibility of a DSL method
#   # @!visibility private
#   cattr_accessor :subclasses
# @example Modifying the visibility of a set of methods
#   # Note that Ruby's "protected" is recommended over this directive
#   # @!visibility protected
#
#   # Documentation for method1
#   def method1; end
