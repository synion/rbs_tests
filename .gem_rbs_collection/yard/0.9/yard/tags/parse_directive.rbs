# Parses a block of code as if it were present in the source file at that
# location. This directive is useful if a class has dynamic meta-programmed
# behaviour that cannot be recognized by YARD.
#
# You can specify the language of the code block using the types
# specification list. By default, the code language is "ruby".
#
# @example Documenting dynamic module inclusion
#   class User
#     # includes "UserMixin" and extends "UserMixin::ClassMethods"
#     # using the UserMixin.included callback.
#     # @!parse include UserMixin
#     # @!parse extend UserMixin::ClassMethods
#   end
# @example Declaring a method as an attribute
#   # This should really be an attribute
#   # @!parse attr_reader :foo
#   def object; @parent.object end
# @example Parsing C code
#   # @!parse [c]
#   #   void Init_Foo() {
#   #     rb_define_method(rb_cFoo, "method", method, 0);
#   #   }
# @since 0.8.0
