# Ends a group listing definition. Group definition automatically end
# when class or module blocks are closed, and defining a new group overrides
# the last group definition, but occasionally you need to end the current
# group to return to the default listing. Use {tag:!group} to begin a
# group listing.
#
# @example
#   class Controller
#     # @!group Callbacks
#
#     def before_filter; end
#     def after_filter; end
#
#     # @!endgroup
#
#     def index; end
#   end
# @see tag:!group
