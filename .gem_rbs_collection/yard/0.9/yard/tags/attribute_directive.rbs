# Defines an attribute with a given name, using indented block data as the
# attribute's docstring. If the type specifier is supplied with "r", "w", or
# "rw", the attribute is made readonly, writeonly or readwrite respectively.
# A readwrite attribute is the default, if no type is specified. The comment
# containing this directive does not need to be attached to any source, but
# if it is, that source code will be used as the method's source.
#
# To define a regular method, see {tag:!method}
#
# @note This directive should only be used if there is no explicit +attr_*+
#   declaration for the attribute in any source files (i.e., the attribute
#   is declared dynamically via meta-programming). In all other cases, add
#   documentation to the attribute declaration itself.
# @note For backwards compatibility support, you do not need to indent
#   the attribute's docstring text. If an +@!attribute+ directive is seen with
#   no indented block, the entire docstring is used as the new attribute's
#   docstring text.
# @example Defining a simple readonly attribute
#   # @!attribute [r] count
#   #   @return [Fixnum] the size of the list
# @example Defining a simple readwrite attribute
#   # @!attribute name
#   #   @return [String] the name of the user
# @see tag:!method
