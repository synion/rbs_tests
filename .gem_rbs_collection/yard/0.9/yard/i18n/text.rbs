  # Extracts translation target messages from +@input+.
  #
  # @yield [:attribute, name, value, line_no] the block that
  #   receives extracted an attribute in header. It may called many
  #   times.
  # @yieldparam [String] name the name of extracted attribute.
  # @yieldparam [String] value the value of extracted attribute.
  # @yieldparam [Integer] line_no the defined line number of extracted
  #   attribute.

  #   receives extracted a paragraph in body. Paragraph is a text
  #   block separated by one or more empty lines. Empty line is a
  #   line that contains only zero or more whitespaces. It may
  #   called many times.
  # @yieldparam [String] text the text of extracted paragraph.
  # @yieldparam [Integer] start_line_no the start line number of
  #   extracted paragraph.
